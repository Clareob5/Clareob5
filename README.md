Hi, I am a final year student in Creative Computing in Dun Laoghaire. I enjoy learning new languages and have all my college projects on my repository.

I code mainly using Python JavaScript and PHP. I am currently working on my skills with Deep learning and CNN.

My pinned projects are my most recent works
The 3rdYearProject and CA1-MedicalCentre are both full stack Laravel projects in PHP with Blade Templates. Both projects have CRUD functionality. In the 3rdYearProject I implemeneted an API to do movie recommendations for users and groups of users.

The College_vue application can be viewed using this link: https://college-vue-cob.web.app/

The React-App-CA2 can be viewed using this link: https://cob-restaurant-react.web.app/

The Pizza-Price-Prediction is a machine learning app that pridicts the price of pizza based on dfferent parameters and it also checks different regression algorithms against eachother ie XGBoost against Linear Regression.
