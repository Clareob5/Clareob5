### Hi, I'm Clare O'Brien :wave:

I am a final year student in Creative Computing in Dun Laoghaire. I enjoy learning new languages and have all my college projects on my repository.
I code mainly using Python, JavaScript and PHP. I am currently working on my skills with Deep learning and CNN.

## Heres my Top used languages 
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=clareob5&layout=compact)](https://github.com/clareob5/github-readme-stats)

## My pinned projects are my most recent works
The 3rdYearProject and CA1-MedicalCentre are both full stack Laravel projects in PHP with Blade Templates. Both projects have CRUD functionality. In the 3rdYearProject I implemeneted an API to do movie recommendations for users and groups of users.

The College_vue application can be viewed using this link: https://college-vue-cob.web.app/

The React-App-CA2 can be viewed using this link: https://cob-restaurant-react.web.app/

The Pizza-Price-Prediction is a machine learning app that pridicts the price of pizza based on dfferent parameters and it also checks different regression algorithms against eachother ie XGBoost against Linear Regression.
